# RPG Quest Pt 2  
### See Screenshots Below!  
### Site is not deployed yet, still work in progress  

## Goals and Challenges:  
- Create cool game UI with multiple screens  
- Set up an effective method of navigation  
- Get a solid grasp of props and state, moving data around the app
- Challenge: Playing a single theme song through each screen (why I switched away from 'react-router-dom')  
- Challenge: Finding effective, elegant ways to modularize code. Wasn't as easy as I thought it'd be
- Challenge: Writing elegant code in general XD

## Takeaways:  
- Code organization is soooo important  
- It's true that the last 10% functionality takes 90% of the time  
- react-router-dom, a useful package, isn't necessary for all navigations. Can create your own render logic
- CSS Grid is so versatile, easy to change grid layouts from screen to screen
- The right images and music can make a game come to life
